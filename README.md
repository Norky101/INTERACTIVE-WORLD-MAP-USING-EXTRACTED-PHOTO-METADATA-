**RESTAURANT REVIEW INTERACTIVE MAP**


**Description**

'Where was this photo taken grandad/ma?' is the type of question you will likely receive one day.

Sadly though the human memory is only so good and it will inevitably forget many things, especially when you take hundreds of pictures per vacation!

Thankfully your problems are solved as I have developed a computer program in Python that can have your GPS data from your camera or phone inputted into an interactive map. Now you can see exactly where your pictures were taken in the world by simply hovering the mouse over the icon on the map.

**What was your motivation?**

As a keen photographer and traveler, I often forget where certain photographs were taken. When sometimes taking 100s of pictures per trip it is very annoying to have to manually check the metadata to see where a picture was taken. 

**What problem does it solve?**

Having the raw GPS coordinates is pretty meaningless as they are just a bunch of random numbers. To give them meaning, I developed the interactive map using python and folium where I could visually display the GPS data.

**What makes your project stand out?**

I solved two problems in one. Firstly, was the problem of not knowing where some of my pictures were taken. Secondly, I solved the lack of use of the solo numbers presented.
This project stands out because anyone can use it and it solves the problem of having to search through each picture via the camera's screen or laptop.

**Why do you use the technologies I used?**

Python is my most knowledgeable language and makes creating the backend much easier. 
Folium library was used to create the map. 
Pandas library was used to read the database file. 
Jupyter Notebook was used for streamlining code and the efficiency of testing it.

**Features you hope to implement in the future.**

I want to turn this program into a website where anyone can upload their forgotten pictures and find out where they were taken.

Hopefully you find some use and joy out of this project!
