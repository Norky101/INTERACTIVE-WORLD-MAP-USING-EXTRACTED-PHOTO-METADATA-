**RESTAURANT REVIEW INTERACTIVE DATA MAP**

**Description**
This program creates an interactive world map that stores the data a user has inputted about a restaurant they have or want to visit. The inputted information is then displayed in an easy to understand manner which can help the user make an informed decision about where they want to eat.


**What was your motivation?**

As a student living on a budget when I want to eat out I want to make sure my money is going to something worthwile and that will make my desire to feast furfilled.

**What problem does it solve?**

When you are hungry you are biased as to was a restaurant any good. However, if you have easy access data from your own opinion, you can then make a more informed decision.

**What makes your project stand out?**

I solved two problems in one. Firstly, was the problem of not knowing where some of my pictures were taken. Secondly, I solved the lack of use of the solo numbers presented.
This project stands out because anyone can use it and it solves the problem of having to search through each picture via the camera's screen or laptop.

**Why do you use the technologies I used?**

Python.

Folium library was used to create the map. 

Pandas library was used to read and create the database file. 

Jupyter Notebook was used for streamlining code and the efficiency of testing it.

**Features you hope to implement in the future.**

Ability to have a drop down feature housing your top 10 restaurants.
Website so anybody can use it.
Ability to notify user of any promos their top 10 restaurants are having.

Hopefully you find some use and joy out of this project!
